# Changelog

**Test Status**
* G - Controller Files
	* 'Device Model Classes' file can be called without any runtime errors.
	* Most tests still fail for now.

---

**./fox-devices/_classes/device-model.class.js**
* Started writing emulation for file.
* The original has three classes but the test script only calls 'StoredDevice' for the time being.
* Only a basic constructor is defined for now. This is enough to avoid runtime errors.
