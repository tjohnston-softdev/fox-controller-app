# Changelog

**Test Status**
* G - Controller Files
	* Wrote emulation for controller rebooting.
	* Since this is only a simulation, actually rebooting the computer is not necessary.
	* Simply exiting the process will do.

**./service.main.js**
* Emulated the 'rebootController' function.
	* Behaves the same as 'restartProcess'
